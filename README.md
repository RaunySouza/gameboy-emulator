# Gameboy Emulator by Rauny

This project is inspired by [Imran Nazar project](http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript).
Its intention is having a better understanding about emulation and basic programming concepts. 
So it serves only as a studying project.

The project is written in kotlin, so it also serves to improve my knowledge about this awesome language.
